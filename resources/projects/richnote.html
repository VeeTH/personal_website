    <h3>RichNote is a basic tabbed note editor. Not only is it capable of standard text editing, but it also supports most basic rich text formatting. Plus, it also has some advanced features like autosaving. RichNote utilizes WinUI 3 to leverage fluent design.</h3>
    <h3>I decided to create RichNote due to my experiences with the Windows 11 Notepad. I loved how much of an improvement it is over the old one, but being a Windows 10 user myself, I can't use it without weird workarounds. So, I decided to write my own program with similar functionality and more.</h3>
