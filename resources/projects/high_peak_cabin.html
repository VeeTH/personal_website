    <h3>Highmarch Cabin is a beautiful player home situated high on the cliffs overlooking Eastmarch. It's slightly north of Ivarstead, so you still have civilization in a somewhat close reach. It has plenty of necessitiesâ€” woodcutting, tannery, enchanting, alchemy, and a creepy mine! However, you don't acquire it right away, as it unfortunately has a bit of a bandit problem.</h3>
