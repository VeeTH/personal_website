    <h3>Karvalken is an average-sized town located next to Gloomreach, along the southern road to Markarth. The slopes of the mountainside have shaped Karvalken into a multi-level town, with many hills and steps. Being located along a lucrative part of the Karth, its primary trade commodity is fish, but it's also popular with general traders due to being right along the main road. It features a mix of races and interesting characters, complete with a few quests.</h3>
