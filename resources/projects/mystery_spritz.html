    <h3><b>Type:</b> Item Mod</h3>
    <h3>A mod that adds a mysterious drink you can find in the shop or randomly in the map. Drinking it gives you a random effect out of a wide array of themâ€” some good, some bad, and some are just funny.</h3>
    <h3>The spawn method and effects are all configurable and toggleable.</h3>
