Last month, the time for our Sophomore Housing Selection came up. The usual process for housing selection goes as follows:

1. Sign the housing agreement
2. Form a roommate/suitemate group (unless you want to be assigned randoms)
3. Receive info through email (your housing selection time slot, etc.)
4. Select your room assignment

We expected the selection for Sophomore year to go smoothly because nothing suggested otherwise; choosing our housing for freshman year went super smoothly. We formed a group and signed the agreement without issue, and were fully prepared to lock in on the time we were assigned to snatch a perfect room.

Everything fell apart when the day preceding our timeslots came, though. Midway through the first day of housing selection, we got this unexpected email stating how housing selection had closed. At first, I thought this was maybe just referring to *that* day and it would reopen at the proper times the following days. However, upon further examination, this email was essentially stating selection for the rest of the period had been closed. Me and my roommates got seriously confused, so me and another went down to the housing office to inquire about this.

We had to send another email to the housing office stating everyone in our group, our preferred roommate pairs, and preferred residence halls. As of writing this, they have been sending us bi-weekly emails on the status of housing, but so far we have not received any resolutions in terms of housing assignment. The whole situation is still kind of in flux.

This is really irritating because it's introducing unneeded stress. Instead of housing being this smooth process, we're now uncertain of everything. We have no clue what hall we'll be placed in, and we have no clue how well they will keep our group of 6 together if at all. All of us have bonded so well together and were excited to live together again, but now that's basically foiled. I'm also freaking out about the prospect of being placed with randoms; I'm paranoid I would just happen to be paired with frat boys or the few other *interesting* characters that go to our school.

Another thing that's irritating me is the fact that I'm now second-guessing my roommate pair. By second guessing, I mean me and someone else now want to room with each other instead of the originally agreed pairs. This wouldn't be a huge problem if we were, y'know, fully dorming together, but now with the fact that they could possibly split our group by roommate pairs, I'm worrying.

Another possibility I was thinking was, well, *what would happen if we literally run out of our own housing?* The next possible options I'd think the college would pursue is either renting out hotels or using the dorms of other Colleges of the Fenway schools. I'd obviously much prefer the later due to it remaining in somewhat close proximity to campus, and it being a traditional dorm. As for a hotel, while it would be further away and we'd lack the ability to customize our rooms, it does come through in some other cases such as room service and in-hotel restauraunts and such.

I honestly think this whole thing is just a symptom of overadmitting. My class, the Class of 2028, was the largest admitting class to date. If any future classes are bigger than mine, well... god help them I guess. Anyway, we have three halls that only Freshman can stay in, while the upperclassmen get three other halls that they can stay in for those whole 3 years. Since upperclassmen can stay in these dorms for so long, that obviously creates a space issue for rising upperclassmen. This should've been taken into account when admissions were being done, but clearly it wasn't. *sigh*...
