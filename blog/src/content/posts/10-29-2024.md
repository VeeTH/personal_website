## You may have noticed this blog stands out from the rest of my site. Here's why.

From this website's beginning, I've always wanted to implement a blog. A self-hosted one that wouldn't be dependent on other platforms like Blogger or Wordpress. I really enjoy writing, and I wanted a place like this where I could freely log my life events, devlogs, and other stuff. Not even for any audience, really- I don't care if nobody reads this. I'm writing for myself, first and foremost.

The only problem was that I had no fucking clue where to even start in terms of making it. I knew I couldn't have a separate page for each post as that would severely bloat my website and make going through the blog very slow. I also wanted advanced features like categories, tags, searching, and so on- all things I have absolutely no idea how to code. So, to sum things up...

**My requirements/desires:**
1. Categories and tags
2. Search functionality
3. Archive page
4. Posts use Markdown

Initially, I thought about using Zonelets to make my blog, but my biggest problem with it was the fact that blog posts use HTML. Markdown is really great because you can write things in plain text and formatting is extremely simple! I did not feel like having to write all of my blog posts in HTML tags when the simplicity of Markdown exists. And so, the search continued...

My continued searching led me, ironically, to services like Wordpress. I could technically embed a Wordpress blog within my site... unfortunately, Wordpress isn't free (well, technically it can be, but the free tier was not what I was looking for), and I did not feel like self-hosting it. However, I kept this idea of embedding another site within mine in my head.

Eventually, my search finally led me to static site generators! These generators are meant to be used to make whole websites with, such as portfolios, blogs, and much more. I realized I coould just use an SSG to create my blog, then embed its pages within the Blog page on my website. Perfect!

I spent a decent amount of time comparing different ones to each other until settling on [Astro](https://astro.build/). I then went between a few different themes before settling on [Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari). This was a perfect solution for me. Fuwari not only looks really pleasing and has nice animations, but it came with categories, tags, an archive, searching, and much more (I've very heavily modified it) all built in. And, best of all, posts are written Markdown!

## As you could probably guess, implementing this blog didn't go exactly smooth.

### The relative link debacle

Initially, I had this package called [Astro Relative Links](https://github.com/ixkaito/astro-relative-links) integrated into the blog. This would generate all the links in the build as relative paths so I could use it through my *local files* instead of the website. Unbeknownst to me, this was the root cause of numerous navigation errors when I'd access the blog through my *website* instead of the local files. The relative links made it so certain links would just append themselves onto the end of the current page's URL, leading to a page that doesn't exist.

I was stuck figuring out this problem for a while and had no clue why it was happening. I attempted countless fixes: changing Astro's base URL, changing the individual page URLs, changing destinations, among other things. None of it worked. Until one day, I decided to try disabling that package as it was the last link-related thing I could think of... and that fixed it. I kicked myself at how long it took me to figure out such a simple fix.

### The catastrophic .git fuckup

*Another time, I wanted to try Fuwari's draft feature. It ended in me having to delete my local files and start over.*

So, Fuwari has this cool feature where you can set posts as a draft. This makes it so the post doesn't show up on the site when you build it.

I had already wrapped up my work on the site for that day when I thought of experimenting with this on a post that I was still writing at the time. I had already committed and pushed that day's changes, so I changed the post into a draft then built the site and ammended the previous commit. What could go wrong?

I was immediately met with a shitton of merge conflicts. I realized that perhaps ammending that commit instead of creating a new one was a bad idea so I tried aborting the commit somehow but I couldn't figure out any way to. I tried commands like `git reset` and `git merge --abort` to no avail.

Then, for some reason, I thought checking out the previous commit would somehow get me out of this situation. Not knowing how detached HEADs work, I thought this would allow me to pull that previous commit and reset the state of my local files. Since my HEAD was now detached, I soon found that to not be the case. I proceeded to frantically search up how to reconnect the HEAD.

I did end up reconnecting the HEAD. I also managed to pull that previous commit, which of course gave me more merge conflicts that I resolved this time. I'm not sure if I completely reconnected the HEAD, though, because now I was getting credential errors every time I tried to sync the changes.

This was where I realized the situation was just way too far gone and I nuked my local files so I could clone the GitHub repo and start over from the commit I tried to ammend. So, moral of the story? Only ammend simple, easily mergeable changes.

## In conclusion...

I now have a really nice and fully functional blog on my site! I'm really happy with it. Could I have found a way less convoluted than using a whole ass SSG just for my blog only to embed it on my already static site? Probably. But you know the saying... if it ain't broke, don't fix it.
