## The beginnings...

So, I became a furry in mid-2022. That is when I bought my current VRChat avatar and commisioned a ref sheet based off of it. I had always wanted a fursuit since the beginning, but at the start I knew it would be a while until I could actually afford one, especially considering I was only 16 at the time and didn't exactly have a stable job or income yet...

Fast forward to February of this year. Now that I had a stable job and income for a while at that point, I could finally afford a fursuit. I researched makers for quite a while and I was having a lot of difficulty finding local (US or Canada based) makers that offered good quality and an artstyle I liked at an affordable price. The fact that I didn't have an Instagram account at the time didn't help either, as a lot of makers I discovered in my search were *only* on Instagram, and you obviously can't DM people without an account.

My original rationale looking for local makers was that communication might be easier and shipping wouldn't take as long. But I just couldn't find any I liked, so I eventually expanded my search into foreign makers. This opened up a lot more options until I finally found a maker that matched my criteria: [Silvena Handmade](https://silvenahandmade.com/). I loved her suit style, the suits looked high quality, and a full partial for my sona was only quoted at $1200!

## Getting the fursuit made

I started off with a payment plan, as while I technically could've afforded to pay the $1200 in full, I didn't feel comfortable doing that. It took me a few months to pay that off doing payments every other week. Only once I paid it off fully did she start working on the suit. It took another few months for the suit to be completed, but this timeline was nothing I didn't expect.

She was really nice throughout the whole process, from the quote to shipping. I would absolutely recommend her to anybody looking to buy a fursuit.

## The final result

This is what the fursuit ended up looking like in person! You can see a picture of me in it on my About Me page.

There were a couple nice surprises, such as the fur looking more vibrant than I expected. I also forgot to tell her what kind of jaw I wanted, so she gave me a movable jaw which is pretty sweet! I'm also pursuing options for fursuit fans because it can get pretty toasty inside the head.

What do I plan to do with it? Well, wear it of course. But I'm also planning on attending my first ever furry convention, Anthro New England 2025, and I am extremely excited to bring Magmum along with me! In fact, conventions are one of the reasons I wanted a fursuit in the first place. Going to them without one is boring!

I'm also hoping to be able to attend Furcationland 2025, but that kinda hinges on whether or not I'm able to afford the hotel + some extra for the dealers den and/or food when the time comes. The con's official hotels were way too expensive for me, so I managed to cop a reservation at the America's Best Value Inn in Scarborough, a 40-ish minute bus ride away from Portland, for only \$79/night and $258 total. Conveniently, it has free cancelation until April 8th.

So, yeah... that is the journey of me getting my fursuit.
